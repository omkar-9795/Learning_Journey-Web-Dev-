### What I Studied
- Learn about Display Property in CSS about inline elements and block elements and how they works.
- Learned about how inline element doesnt respect width and height properties of CSS
- Also Studied about the inline-block type of display property where the elements become inline which keeping their CSS properties fully like a block element
- Then I learned about some relative units like percentage, em, rem
- Also find out about why the bullet points in list items of any ordered or unordered list get removed when we make them inline because their default dispaly properties being the list-items

### Practice

- The second practice question was about making three circles and placing them in a line while keeping their CSS properties for which I used the inline-block type of display porperty
- The third one was about why the bullet point get removed in list items when we make them inline
